# Wallpaper switcher for [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww)
- It uses dbus for communication between the deamon and switcher scripts.
- Time between automatic switches is configurable in the code.

## Usage
- Install [pydbus](https://github.com/LEW21/pydbus) and [dbus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus) on your system.
- Then run the `deamon.py` right after you start the swww-deamon.
- Optionally create keybindings for `next.py` and `prev.py`
